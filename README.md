# GKE Cluster Setup with Terraform

This README provides a simple guide for setting up a GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) cluster with Terraform. It covers the process of creating the required GCP resources, such as the VPC network, subnetwork, and the GKE cluster, all managed by Terraform. This setup will first focus on a Dev environment, but can be easily repeated or adjusted for other environments like Production.

## Steps to Deploy the GKE Cluster

### 1. Create the S3 Bucket for Managing Terraform State

This step needs to be done manually. We will use Google Cloud Storage to manage the Terraform state.

```bash
gsutil mb -l us-central1 -b on gs://terraform-state-bucket
```

### 2. Apply the Terraform Configuration for Each Module

#### a. CD into the `envs/dev` directory

```bash
cd envs/dev
```

#### b. Apply the `00-foundation` Module
- Create a `tfvars` file with your variables specific to the foundation setup (e.g., project ID, region, etc.)
- Apply the `00-foundation` module to set up the basic foundation resources.

```bash
terraform apply -var-file="00-foundation.tfvars"
```

#### c. Apply the `01-network` Module
- Create a `tfvars` file with your network-specific variables (e.g., network name, subnet configurations, etc.)
- Apply the `01-network` module to create the VPC network and subnets for your GKE cluster.

```bash
terraform apply -var-file="01-network.tfvars"
```

#### d. Apply the `02-cluster` Module
- Create a `tfvars` file with your GKE cluster-specific variables (e.g., cluster name, node count, service account, etc.)
- Apply the `02-cluster` module to set up your GKE cluster in the network and subnetwork created in step 2b.

```bash
terraform apply -var-file="02-cluster.tfvars"
```

### 3. Verify the GKE Cluster

After applying all the modules, you should have a fully functioning GKE cluster in the Dev environment.

- You can verify the cluster is up and running by checking in the Google Cloud Console or using `gcloud` CLI commands to interact with the cluster.

### 4. Repeat for Other Environments (Optional)

To create clusters in other environments (e.g., Production), repeat the above steps but with different variables for the environment-specific configuration.

```bash
# For example, switch to the prod directory
cd envs/prod
```

Repeat the `terraform apply` steps for each environment to create isolated GKE clusters with the appropriate configurations.

## Notes:
- Ensure the service account `gke-node-sa` exists in your project, or modify the account ID to match your existing GKE node service account.
- The state management for Terraform is handled by the Google Cloud Storage bucket you created, ensuring that Terraform’s state is stored remotely and can be shared across teams.
- After initial setup, you can customize and scale your GKE clusters based on the environment's needs.
